Predict rocket launch delays with Decision Tree
The objective of this research is:
- To increase the likelihood that the day chosen for launch will be a good weather day.
- To know what conditions should stop a launch.
The expertise that's needed to reach those goals is found in the contributions of meteorologists, physicists, biologists, rocket scientists, and many others. SMEs help by scoping factors that potentially affect a launch and so require critical attention, thereby minimizing the number of variables to analyze.
